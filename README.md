Book Notes:

    Javascript is used to make webpages interactive. Press a button and it 
    turns a square from red to green, for example.

        HTML = content
        CSS = presentation
        Javascript = interactive

    Javascript code can be embedded within your HTML code, using the <script>
    tags.

    Javascripts data types (3 total):

        number
        string
        boolean

    Otherwise it looks very similar to C:

        var my_string = "hello";
        var my_num = 12;
        var my_bool = true;

        if (my_bool) {
            alert(my_string);
        }

    Using your web browser's DEVELOPER TOOLS lets you debug code that isn't
    working as expected. In your browser, press F12.
